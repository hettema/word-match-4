# Integration Process

This document describes the step-by-step integration process for the Word Match game.

## Overview

The integration process follows these key principles:
1. Build one module at a time
2. Verify event contracts with ice cubes tests
3. Never proceed if events don't match contracts
4. Use the integration dashboard to track progress
