- [ ] **ENGINE-01b**: Grid Visual Creation üü°
**Description:** Add grid creation logic to GameScene without rendering
**Context:** Create visual components but keep them hidden

**üìä Visual Progress at localhost:8080:**
- Still shows visual stub scene
- Console logs show grid structure being created
- Console logs confirm tile sprites initialized
- NO visual game yet (tiles are hidden)

**Prerequisites:** Complete ENGINE-01a first

**üìñ Required Reading (COMPLETE, NO SKIMMING)**
‚Ä¢ `style-guide.md` - Tile Implementation section (lines 54-153)
‚Ä¢ Review GridLogic.js to understand grid dimensions

**üõ°Ô∏è Guard Rail Checklist (BEFORE CODING):**
‚Ä¢ [ ] Verified ENGINE-01a is complete and working
‚Ä¢ [ ] Confirmed gridLogic available in registry
‚Ä¢ [ ] Calculated grid centering math
‚Ä¢ [ ] Planned tile sprite structure

**üîó Integration Strategy**
**Emits:** None
**Listens:** No new listeners (reuses ENGINE-01a setup)
**Dependencies:** EventBus.js, EventTypes.js, Phaser, GridLogic (from registry)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
‚Ä¢ [ ] createGrid() method added
‚Ä¢ [ ] Gets grid dimensions from this.gridLogic
‚Ä¢ [ ] Creates 2D array of tile sprites
‚Ä¢ [ ] Each tile has container, background, text, valueText
‚Ä¢ [ ] Tiles centered on screen
‚Ä¢ [ ] All tiles setVisible(false) by default
‚Ä¢ [ ] Console logs confirm creation
‚Ä¢ [ ] Total file still under 100 lines

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use container approach for each tile
- Store sprites in this.tileSprites[y][x]
- Include gridX, gridY in sprite data
- Background rectangle with stroke
- Two text objects (letter and value)

**Key Files:** src/engine/GameScene.js
**Effort:** S | **Risk:** Low
