- [ ] **ENGINE-01c**: Grid Rendering Implementation 🔴
**Description:** Implement renderGrid to make the game visible!
**Context:** THIS IS WHEN THE GAME BECOMES VISIBLE AT localhost:8080! 🎮

**📊 Visual Progress at localhost:8080:**
- **GAME IS NOW VISIBLE!** 🎉
- Grid of tiles appears on screen
- Special tiles show correct visuals
- Empty spaces show as gaps
- Game looks like a real word match game!

**Prerequisites:** Complete ENGINE-01a and ENGINE-01b first

**📖 Required Reading (COMPLETE, NO SKIMMING)**
• `GameBootstrap.js` - How test grid is created (lines 174-210)
• `style-guide.md` - Color palette and display text

**🛡️ Guard Rail Checklist (BEFORE CODING):**
• [ ] ENGINE-01a and 01b working perfectly
• [ ] Understand grid data structure from GRID_UPDATED
• [ ] Have color mappings ready
• [ ] Have display text mappings ready

**🔗 Integration Strategy**
**Emits:** None
**Listens:** Responds to GRID_UPDATED events
**Dependencies:** Existing from previous tasks + color constants

**Acceptance Criteria:**
• [ ] renderGrid() fully implemented
• [ ] Shows/hides tiles based on grid data
• [ ] Updates tile colors based on type
• [ ] Updates display text (letters or symbols)
• [ ] Updates value text for normal tiles
• [ ] getTileAt() helper implemented
• [ ] **Manual test: emit GRID_UPDATED and SEE THE GAME**
• [ ] Total file ~150-175 lines

**Testing the Visibility:**
1. GameBootstrap already emits test grid data
2. Refresh localhost:8080
3. You should see the actual game grid!

**Implementation Notes:**
- Check for null tiles (empty spaces)
- Use getTileColor(type) helper
- Use getTileDisplayText(tile) helper
- Show/hide value text based on tile type
- Clear any previous effects
