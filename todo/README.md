## Architecture Overview

The game follows an event-driven architecture with these key principles:

1. **Pure Functions + Adapters**: Core logic is pure, adapters handle event communication
2. **EventBus**: All systems communicate via EventBus only
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each module does ONE thing
4. **No Coordinators**: Direct coupling between systems is forbidden

## Categories

- üü£ **Infrastructure**: Foundation systems
- üîµ **Core Logic**: Business/domain logic
- üü¢ **Processing**: Core engines/runtime
- üü° **Interface**: UI/API layer
- üü† **Feature**: User functionality
- üî¥ **Bug**: Fixes and issues
- ‚ö™ **Polish**: Optimization/UX
- üü§ **Deployment**: Production/ops

## Development Process

1. Complete tasks in the specified order
2. Move completed tasks from `todo` to `done` folder using the `mv` shell command
3. Follow the guard rail checklist for each task
4. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met and that all tests are successful before marking a task as done
5. When running tests use the `npx http-serve` command to start a local web server
6. Maintain a test index file in the root test folder with easy access to all tests in the browser
7. When committing files to git, use the command `git add .`

## Development Phases

The development is organized into these main phases:

1. **Foundation (Tasks 1-6)**: Set up the event-driven architecture foundation
2. **Core Logic (Tasks 7-11)**: Implement the pure logic modules
3. **Adapters (Tasks 12-15)**: Connect pure logic to the event system
4. **Engine & UI (Tasks 16-22)**: Implement rendering and user interface
5. **Core Features (Tasks 23-25)**: Implement basic game mechanics
6. **Special Tiles (Tasks 26-30)**: Add special tile types
7. **Polish & Testing (Tasks 31-34)**: Optimize and ensure compatibility

## v3.1 Improvements Summary

Based on risk analysis, the following improvements were added to increase success probability from 72% to 90%+:

1. **Contract Validation**: Runtime validation catches event data mismatches immediately
2. **Automated Testing**: No more manual console checking - automatic pass/fail reporting
3. **Integration Dashboard**: Visual confirmation of module communication status
4. **Event Replay**: Debug complex cascade sequences by replaying events
5. **Stress Testing**: Validate cascade performance under extreme conditions early
6. **Early Benchmarking**: Track performance from Phase 4, not waiting until Polish phase

These additions specifically address the main risk areas:
- Integration complexity across 34 modules
- Cascade timing synchronization issues
- Browser-only testing constraints
- Event contract drift
- Performance under load
