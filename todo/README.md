## Architecture Overview

The game follows an event-driven architecture with these key principles:

1. **Pure Functions + Adapters**: Core logic is pure, adapters handle event communication
2. **EventBus**: All systems communicate via EventBus only
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each module does ONE thing
4. **No Coordinators**: Direct coupling between systems is forbidden

## Categories

- üü£ **Infrastructure**: Foundation systems
- üîµ **Core Logic**: Business/domain logic
- üü¢ **Processing**: Core engines/runtime
- üü° **Interface**: UI/API layer
- üü† **Feature**: User functionality
- üî¥ **Bug**: Fixes and issues
- ‚ö™ **Polish**: Optimization/UX
- üü§ **Deployment**: Production/ops

## Development Process

1. Complete tasks in the specified order
2. Move completed tasks from `todo` to `done` folder using the `mv` shell command
3. Follow the guard rail checklist for each task
4. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met and that all tests are successful before marking a task as done
5. When running tests use the `npx http-serve` command to start a local web server
6. Maintain a test index file in the root test folder with easy access to all tests in the browser
7. When committing files to git, use the command `git add .`

## Development Phases

The development is organized into these main phases:

1. **Foundation (Tasks 1-6)**: Set up the event-driven architecture foundation ‚úÖ
2. **Core Logic (Tasks 7-11)**: Implement the pure logic modules ‚úÖ
3. **Adapters (Tasks 12-17)**: Connect pure logic to the event system ‚úÖ
4. **Engine (Tasks 16-19)**: Implement game engine components ‚úÖ
5. **UI (Tasks 20-22)**: Implement user interface
6. **Core Features (Tasks 23-26)**: Implement basic game mechanics and level system
7. **Special Tiles (Tasks 27-31)**: Add special tile types
8. **Polish & Testing (Tasks 32-36)**: Sound, animations, optimization, and compatibility

## v3.1 Improvements Summary

Based on risk analysis, the following improvements were added to increase success probability from 72% to 90%+:

1. **Contract Validation**: Runtime validation catches event data mismatches immediately
2. **Automated Testing**: No more manual console checking - automatic pass/fail reporting
3. **Integration Dashboard**: Visual confirmation of module communication status
4. **Event Replay**: Debug complex cascade sequences by replaying events
5. **Stress Testing**: Validate cascade performance under extreme conditions early
6. **Early Benchmarking**: Track performance from Phase 4, not waiting until Polish phase

## v3.2 Improvements Summary

Based on code review and gap analysis, the following tasks were added for a complete game:

1. **Level System (FEATURES-09)**: Essential for game progression and JSON-based level loading per PRD requirements
2. **Sound System (POLISH-00)**: Audio feedback for all game actions enhances user experience

These additions specifically address missing core functionality:
- Level progression and configuration system
- Audio feedback for player actions
- Complete game loop with multiple levels
